An Iranian-British woman detained while trying to attend a men's volleyball was sentenced to one year in prison Sunday.

Lawyer Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei told The Associated Press on Sunday that a court found 25-year-old Ghoncheh Ghavami guilty of "propagating against the ruling system." Tabatabaei says he has been shown the text of the verdict but is still waiting to officially receive it.

Women who sought to attend the World League match in June were reportedly turned away from the stadium. Female photographers inside the complex were ordered to leave though none were arrested.

Ghavami was detained in June at a stadium in Tehran. She was held initially for a few hours and released only to be detained again a few days later. She stood trial last month.

During her detention, Ghavami was held in solitary confinement. At Tehran's evin prison, she started a hunger strike to protest her detainment.

 Iran's judiciary spokesman, Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejehi, has criticized reports linking Ghavami's arrest to volleyball, saying last month: "Her case has nothing to do with sports."
